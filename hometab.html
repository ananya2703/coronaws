  <h3> <ul>  
    <li> Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal.</li>
    <li> Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. In cows and pigs they cause diarrhea, while in mice they cause hepatitis and encephalomyelitis.</li> 
    <li> Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria. They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry. The genome size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases, one of the largest among RNA viruses. They have characteristic club-shaped spikes that project from their surface, which in electron micrographs create an image reminiscent of the solar corona, from which their name derives.</li> 
    <li>The history of coronaviruses is a reflection of the discovery of the diseases caused by coronaviruses and identification of the viruses. It starts with the first report of a new type of upper-respiratory tract disease among chickens in North Dakota, US, in 1931. The causative agent was identified as a virus in 1933. By 1936, the disease and the virus were recognised as unique from other viral disease. The became known as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), but later officially renamed as Avian coronavirus.</li>

    <h1 class="border2"> The COVID-19 Pandemic </h1> <br>
    <h3> <ul>
      <li> The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</li>
      <li> The virus was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern regarding COVID-19 on 30 January 2020, and later declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 27 April 2021, more than 148 million cases have been confirmed, with more than 3.12 million deaths attributed to COVID-19, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in history.</li>
      <li> Symptoms of COVID-19 are highly variable, ranging from none to life-threateningly severe. Transmission of COVID-19 occurs mainly when an infected person is in close contact with another person. Small droplets containing the virus leave an infected person as they breathe, cough, sneeze, or speak and enter another person via their mouth, nose, or eyes.</li>
      <li> Airborne transmission is also sometimes possible, as smaller infected droplets can linger in the air for minutes to hours within enclosed spaces that have inadequate ventilation. Less commonly, the virus may spread via contaminated surfaces. People remain contagious for up to 20 days, and can spread the virus even if they do not develop any symptoms. </li>

      <h1>Variants of SARS-CoV-2</h1> 
      <h3> 
        <ul>
          <li>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has many variants; some are believed or have been believed to be of particular importance due to their potential for increased transmissibility, increased virulence, and reduced effectiveness of vaccines against them. </li>
          <li>The sequence WIV04/2019, belonging to the GISAID S clade / PANGO A lineage / Nextstrain 19B clade, is thought to most closely reflect the sequence of the original virus infecting humans known as "sequence zero", and is widely used as a reference sequence. </li>
          <li> A new "double mutant" variant of the coronavirus has been detected from samples collected in India.Officials are checking if the variant, where two mutations come together in the same virus, may be more infectious or less affected by vaccines.</li>
          <li> Some 10,787 samples from 18 Indian states also showed up 771 cases of known variants - 736 of the UK, 34 of the South African and one Brazilian. Officials say the variants are not linked to a spike in cases in India.</li>
          <li>The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics (INSACOG), a group of 10 national laboratories under India's health ministry, carried out genomic sequencing on the latest samples. Genomic sequencing is a testing process to map the entire genetic code of an organism - in this case, the virus. The genetic code of the virus works like its instruction manual.</li>
          <li>Mutations in viruses are common but most of them are insignificant and do not cause any change in its ability to transmit or cause serious infection. But some mutations, like the ones in the UK or South Africa variant lineages, can make the virus more infectious and in some cases even deadlier.</li>
          <li>Virologist Shahid Jameel explained that a "double mutation in key areas of the virus's spike protein may increase these risks and allow the virus to escape the immune system".</li>
          <li>The spike protein is the part of the virus that it uses to penetrate human cells.What are the risks of India's new Covid-19 variant Sharp rise in India Covid cases 'alarming' The government said that an analysis of the samples collected from India's western Maharashtra state showed "an increase in the fraction of samples with the E484Q and L452R mutations" compared with December last year.</li>
          <li>"Such [double] mutations confer immune escape and increased infectivity," the health ministry said in a statement.Dr Jameel added that "there may be a separate lineage developing in India with the L452R and E484Q mutations coming together". </li> </h3>

    <h1> At-Home Coronavirus Treatment </h1>
    <li> If your symptoms are mild enough that you can recover at home, you should:</li> 
    <li> Rest. It can make you feel better and may speed your recovery. </li>
    <li>Stay home. Don't go to work, school, or public places. </li>
    <li>Drink fluids. You lose more water when you're sick. Dehydration can make symptoms worse and cause other health problems. </li>
    <li> Monitor. If your symptoms get worse, call your doctor right away. Don't go to their office without calling first. They might tell you to stay home, or they may need to take extra steps to protect staff and other patients. </li>
<li> Ask your doctor about over-the-counter medicines that may help, like acetaminophen to lower your fever.</li> </ul> </h3>
      <h1> Commonly used drugs for treatments of COVID-19 </h1>
      <ul> <h3> 
        <li> During a public health emergency, such as COVID-19, the FDA can issue an emergency use authorization (EUA) to help make new medications and medical products more available to patients. </li>
        <li> Remdesivir (Veklury) - Remdesivir is an antiviral that is given by intravenous (IV) infusion in the hospital. </li>
        <li> Dexamethasone - Dexamethasone is a common corticosteroid (steroid) medication that has been used for many years to treat various health conditions, such as autoimmune conditions and allergic reactions. </li>
        <li> Convalescent Plasma - Convalescent plasma is collected from people who have recovered from COVID-19. It is then transfused into someone with an active coronavirus infection. It is thought that antibodies found in the convalescent plasma can help fight the coronavirus infection. </li>
        <li> Monoclonal Antibodies - Monoclonal antibodies (MABs) are antibodies made in a lab. It can take the body weeks to develop natural antibodies, so using MABs can potentially fight off infections sooner. </li>
        <li> Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine -  Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are two medications that have been used for many decades to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. A few small studies initially suggested that they may also be helpful for treating hospitalized patients with mild cases of COVID-19. </li>
        <li> Azithromycin - Azithromycin (informally known as a Z-pak) is an antibiotic commonly used to treat bacterial infections such as bronchitis and pneumonia. It has been shown to have some in vitro activity against viruses like influenza A and Zika. </li> </ul> </div>
